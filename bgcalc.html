                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>
                        Flutter implementation of an Android phone application where users can do their end-game scoring when playing board games.
                        Users can either use the premade calculation sheets for some of the specific board games or use an empty sheet that can be customized. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        Most board games provides a way to keep track of player scores either with a sheet of paper of a meeple that moves around the board.
                        Some of the more complex games have many ways for players to score points and to calculate the total end game scoring would normally require a calculator.
                        Hence, I decided to make a mobile application that can substitute the use of paper and make all the calculations.

                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app has some built-in templates for a few games that users can use to help in score calculations.
                        There is also an empty sheet that users can customize into any board games by adding up to 10 players and 20 different scoring categories.
                        Each of the players and categories can be renamed to fit the users. 
                        Users can also sort on any of the categories to see who did the best on that scoring category.

                    <h3>Future Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app is currently in works to be published on the Google Play Store. 
                        In the future, I am planning to release it on the Apple App Store and work on adding more templates for more games.
                        Also, with more user feedback, I will further improve the sheets and add more features to the app.
