                    <p>
                        A web application made particularly for the soccer board game, UND1C1 fans. Through the application, users can
                        keep track of the score while playing and have a running log of all their games played. Users can also access
                        the current live tables of the top leagues in Europe.

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://und1c1.com/">UND1C1</a> is a soccer board game made by DM Giochi Srls and was funded through Kickstarter.
                        As a backer, I really enjoy playing the game and would love to share this guy to others so that they can enjoy it especially those
                        who love to play board games and soccer. The game does not come with a scoreboard and is why I decided to make this web application.

                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app uses the livescore API to access real-time live tables for the major soccer leagues in Europe.
                        The app allows users to start a new game with customizable names and team names where they can keep track of the score of their current game.
                        Upon completing the game, the results of the game will be stored in the history where users can look back at all their games played.
                        Users can also filter games played by a particular manager name through searching.

                    <h3>Future Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app is currently hosted through Cyclic and I am working on a mobile application version with improved UI and features.
                        In the future, I would add and improve the functionality of the application as well as improve the UI.
